## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **Component Architecture:**
```
ClassTimetable
├── Header (title, navigation buttons)
├── Today's Classes (special highlight section)
├── Weekly Schedule (time-based layout)
└── Quick Info Cards (feature explanations)
```

### **Data Structure:**
```typescript
interface ClassSchedule {
  id: string;
  title: string;

  platform: 'meet' | 'zoom' | 'teams';
  status: 'upcoming' | 'live' | 'completed';
  enrolledStudents: number;
  maxStudents: number;
  description?: string;
}
```

### **Smart Join Logic:**
```typescript
const isJoinable = (classData) => {
  if (classData.status === 'live') return true;
  
  const now = new Date();
  const classStart = new Date(classData.scheduledAt);
  const timeDiff = classStart.getTime() - now.getTime();
  const minutesDiff = timeDiff / (1000 * 60);
  
  // Allow joining 15 minutes before, 30 minutes after start
  return minutesDiff <= 15 && minutesDiff >= -30;
};
```
