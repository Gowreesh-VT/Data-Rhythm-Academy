});
```

### 2. Amount Calculation
```typescript
const { baseAmount, taxAmount, totalAmount } = calculateTotalAmount(
  coursePrice,   // Base course price
  0.18,         // 18% GST rate
  0             // Processing fee (optional)
);
```

### 3. Auto-Enrollment
```typescript
// After successful payment
const enrollmentResult = await enrollInCourse(userId, courseId, {

3. **Payment Failure**: Invalid card, insufficient funds, etc.
4. **Network Issues**: Poor connectivity during payment
5. **Configuration Errors**: Missing or invalid Razorpay keys

### 💻 **Test Environment**

- Verify GST calculations and total amounts
- Test on mobile devices for responsive experience

## Production Deployment

### 🚀 **Pre-deployment Checklist**
- [ ] Replace test Razorpay keys with production keys
- [ ] Verify webhook configuration (for backend integration)
- [ ] Test payment flow in production environment
- [ ] Verify SSL certificate for secure payments
- [ ] Test error handling and recovery flows

### 🔒 **Security Considerations**
- Never expose Razorpay secret keys in frontend code
- Implement server-side payment verification
- Use HTTPS for all payment-related pages
- Validate payment signatures on backend

## Backend Integration (Future Enhancement)

1. **Create Order**: Generate Razorpay order with proper amount verification
2. **Verify Payment**: Server-side payment signature verification
3. **Process Enrollment**: Update user enrollment status after verified payment
4. **Handle Webhooks**: Process Razorpay webhook notifications

### 📡 **API Endpoints Needed**
```
POST /api/payments/create-order
