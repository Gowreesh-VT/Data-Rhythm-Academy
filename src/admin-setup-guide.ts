/**
 * Admin User Creation Guide
 * 
 * This guide explains how to create an admin user for the Data Rhythm Academy platform.
 * 
 * Method 1: Manual Database Entry (Recommended for first admin)
 * 1. Go to Firebase Console -> Firestore Database
 * 2. Navigate to the 'users' collection
 * 3. Find your user document (created when you first sign up)
 * 4. Edit the document and change the 'role' field from 'student' to 'admin'
 * 5. Add the following fields if they don't exist:
 *    - profileStatus: 'active'
 *    - permissions: {
 *        canManageUsers: true,
 *        canManageCourses: true,
 *        canViewAnalytics: true,
 *        canManagePayments: true,
 *        canManageContent: true,
 *        canAccessSystemSettings: true,
 *        canChangeUserRoles: true,
 *        canSuspendUsers: true,
 *        canDeleteUsers: true,
 *        canAssignInstructorStudents: true
 *      }
 *    - assignedStudents: []
 *    - assignedInstructors: []
 * 
 * Method 2: Using Admin Panel (Once you have an admin account)
 * 1. Log in as an admin user
 * 2. Navigate to /admin-dashboard
 * 3. Go to User Management tab
 * 4. Find the user you want to promote
 * 5. Click Edit and change their role to 'admin'
 * 
 * Default Admin Permissions:
 * - Manage all users (students, instructors, other admins)
 * - Change user roles and status
 * - Assign students to instructors
 * - View system analytics
 * - Manage courses and content
 * - Access system settings
 * 
 * Admin Dashboard Features:
 * - User Management: View, edit, suspend, or promote users
 * - Role Management: Change user roles between student, instructor, and admin
 * - Instructor-Student Relationships: Assign students to specific instructors
 * - System Analytics: View user statistics and activity
 * - Audit Logs: Track all administrative actions
 * 
 * Security Notes:
 * - Admin accounts have full system access
 * - All admin actions are logged in the 'admin_logs' collection
 * - Consider implementing 2FA for admin accounts
 * - Regularly review admin permissions and access
